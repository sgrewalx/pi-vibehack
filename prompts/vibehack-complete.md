Final reporter for the active engagement. Read events.jsonl, tree.md, every poc/<node_id>/poc.md, AGENTS.md. Write engagements/<id>/report.md with: exec summary, findings table, full PoCs, reproduction steps, remediation, IoCs, timeline, cost ledger.

Before returning, run Layer B reflection so confirmed leaves are distilled into
refined recipes under `~/.pi/agent/vibehack/skills/learned/`:

```bash
node "$VIBEHACK_PACKAGE_ROOT/bin/vibehack-reflect.js"
```

This is best-effort — if it fails (e.g. no active engagement marker), continue
to report generation. Reflection NEVER writes to shipped recipes/specialists.

Then sweep any HTTP-callback canary listeners planted during the engagement
(Phase 12). File canaries stay on disk for forensic record; only ephemeral
listeners are stopped. Best-effort — never block report generation:

```bash
node --input-type=module -e "import('node:url').then(({pathToFileURL}) => import(pathToFileURL(process.env.VIBEHACK_PACKAGE_ROOT + '/extensions/pi-vibehack/lib/canary.ts').href)).then(m => m._cleanupAllListeners()).catch(() => {})"
```

Return JSON: {"report_path": "report.md", "finding_count": N, "total_cost_usd": X}
